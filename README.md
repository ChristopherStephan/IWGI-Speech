SpeechAndLeaflet

To test it you need to run the html site within a web server. Browse the site with Chrome. To start interacting with the map by speech, first click the button, allow microphone access from browser and then you can use "zoom out", "zoom in", "up", "down", "left", "right" as commands to control the map's state.  
You can also use "Adding Street Network" and "Removing Street Network" to add and remove the corresponding layer.  
All sources come from geo-arcgis server...will be changed later on.  
Webpage uses ArcGIS Services. Functionality to use CartoDB Layer is also supported by the LVector library.  
Cf. code to get an overview about implemented speech commands.
