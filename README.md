To test it, you need to run the .html site within a web server like apache or tomcat. For an easy installation you could use packages like XAMPP. 

 1. Clone the repository 
 2. Copy all files to the htcdocs of your installed webserver. 
 3. Browse the site with Google Chrome. Other Browser are not supported, because the application uses heavily Googles WebSpeech API, which only works with Google Chrome. We're currently investigating other options using PocketSphinx or other libs.
 4. To start interacting with the map by speech, first click the green button, allow microphone access from browser. There you have the following options:

**How to run**

 - Run the GRT_Predict.exe -file with your Kinect connected 
 - If you use Microsoft Kinect for windows, you will have to install an additional driver (SDK): http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindowsdev/Downloads.aspx
 - To Initialize hands, wave your right hand first, than wave your left and than.  
 - If your hands get lost, put them down and wait for 15 seconds or so. Than repeat the procedure.

**Gestures and functionality**
 - grab with left hand (grab gesture) --> left mouse down release left
 - hand (release gesture) --> left mouse up 
 - click with any hand (push your hand/arm/fingertips forward) --> +-key 
 - grab with left hand and click with the other hand --> -key
 - --> How to pan: grab with your left hand, then pan with your right hand whereas your left hand stays still
 - --> How to zoom in: "click" with one of your hands 
 - --> How to zoom out: "click" with your right hand while holding the grab position with your left hand
   
**Shortcuts for lost and found hands:** 
 - ctrl + shift + F1: found right hand 
 - ctrl + shift + , (comma): lost   
 - right hand ctrl + shift + l is now: lost 
 - left hand ctrl + shift + k is now: found left hand
